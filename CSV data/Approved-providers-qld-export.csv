This condition applies from 1 October 2025 and will remain in force until such time as, in respect to its service approvals for NSW education and care services:
a. 95% or more of those services are rated at or above Meeting the National Quality Standard (calculated based on the number of services in NSW that are currently rated and, of those services, the percentage that are rated at Meeting the NQS or above (and rounded to the nearest whole percentage). In addition to condition 1, the approved provider agrees that in the event that any of its existing services are divested it will not seek to add any education and care services to its existing portfolio until 1 March 2026, to allow it to place an increased focus on compliance and operational improvement across its existing education and care services operating in NSW. From the date of the commencement of these conditions and every three months thereafter, the approved provider must submit to the Regulatory Authority its Quality Improvement Plans for:
a. each of its NSW education and care services that are rated at Working Towards the National Quality Standard as at 1 October 2025; and 
b. any of its NSW education and care services that are rated at Working Towards the National Quality Standard after 1 October 2025 but before 30 September
2026. This condition excludes any services with an existing rating of Working Towards the National Quality Standards that are acquired by the approved provider after 1 March 2026
These plans must demonstrate progress towards addressing all quality areas rated as Working Towards. From 1 October 2025 the approved provider must ensure that in each of its NSW education and care services that are rated at Working Towards the National Quality Standards as at 1 October 2025, the educator to child ratios are maintained above the requirements of the National Law as per the following required levels:
a. for children from birth to 24 months of age - 1 educator to 3 children;
b. for children over 24 months of age and less than 36 months of age—1 educator to 4 children; and
c. for children aged 36 months of age or over (not including children over preschool age) - 1 educator to 8 children.
This condition remains in force in respect to each service for a period of 15 months or until such time as the service is re-assessed and achieves a rating of Meeting the 
National Quality Standards or above, whichever is the earlier. Within three months of the commencement of these conditions the approved provider must submit to the Regulatory Authority for approval a detailed plan to provide additional child safety training to all staff currently working at each of its NSW education and care services. This plan must include:
a. The details of the training provider(s) that will deliver the sessions
b. The content that will be included
c.
